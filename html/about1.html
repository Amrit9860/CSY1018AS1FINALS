<p style="background:linear-gradient(lightblue, lightgreen, aqua, lightyellow, skyblue)">Hello, my name is Amrit Thapa. A front end developers. My birthplace is Dhunibesi Dhading Nepal. I was born in 1999. I started my school level with the computer base. I was good in computer in primary level, lower secondary level, secondary level and higher secondary level too.  At the age of 15 I started to learn computer programming and now I successfully became the front end developer. I don’t think computer programming is that hard to learn. It is all about the mind game. A person who can easily move their mind or play with coding can easily learn programming. It took me 3 years to become a front end developer, it directly shows that I can’t play with coding in mind easily, it takes more time to understand what happens and how this had to be done. As there is a saying that the practice makes a man perfect, I think this is true. After 1 year of starting programming, I got confused which kind of syntax are to be used according to  different types of webpages, but now, without any confusion and any disturbances, I can easily make webpages quickly and effectively.. I believe in my hard word. One day I will success. I don’t want to become a website developer but I also want to become a black hat hacker and a computer programmer. The life of programmer is easy when a programmer programs has no bugs but the programmer has the most irritating life as well. As a saying a bugs makes a programmer grow faster. This is very true. Only a semicolon can ruined the life of the programmer. There are not easy to become a programmer but I believed on myself.  </p></div>
