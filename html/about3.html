	My favorite developer is Mark Zuckerbergs. He developed Facebook which is now number 1 social media which is used. He was born in May 14 1984 in White plains New York, USA. Now he recently lives in Palo Alto, California USA. He is also known as founder of Facebook. Facebook is themost used social media in the world. Billions of users uses Facebook. Facebook is that kind of social media where we can post our feelings and friends can easily make fun of us. We can message and call easily through Facebook.
