	â€¢	My favorite Search engine is Google. Google was found in September 4 1998 at California USA. The founders of Google were Larry Page and Sergey Brin. As  Larry page was born in USA but Sergey Brin was born in Russia. According to 2018 survey Sergey Brin is the 17th richest person in the world. Both of the founders have the citizen of America. Google is a big search engine in an entire world nowadays. Google introduce lots of his parts. Like Gmail, Google Photos, Google Maps, Google Chrome, Google Duo, Google Plus, Google Earth, YouTube, Google play store etc. The Google user in the world reaches billions of billions of user in entire world. The Google Company is located at California USA. The Story begins when the Yahoo Company runs the market. The Google founder cannot lose and keep the new features and bring it to the number 1 search engine in the world. I heard someday that the yahoo offers google to sell the company to them but Google cannot get back and take it in this position this day. Google is the most used search engine nowadays whereas yahoo gets down from the list of mostly used search engine.
