	<h2><b>1.	Get Started</b></h2>
	<p>This is a 12 week project, I had developed a portfolio. I had design by taking some knowledge from other, by looking other portfolio and by mine idea as well. To make this I had created sketches, wireframe to make my design quite good. I had created this only by using HTML, HTML 5, Css3 and Css. This is a most important to make my website excellent. Here is some of the sources from where I had get ideas about what kind of design should I had to make and what content should I have included in which section or part of the websites.<br>

<p>             This page contains all the social media links. This page contain the social media links like Facebook links, instagram link,  Google+ link, Twitter link, Github link, VK link etc. In my web site I had use a header and navigation bar and below that I had used an image slider which is made from html and css3. Below that I had put all my social media links in that body parts.</p><br>
<h2><b>4.5.	 Contact page</b></h2>
<p>This page is a very important page. This page contain the phone number, Email address Location and other which helps other to find us easily. In my website I had the header and navigation bar at top and the email address, phone number, Skype number and viber number in a row. Then below this Google map with my exact location is given with the location. And in the footer bar of this page there contain phone number and email. Then there is a direct link to email me directly and a html forms is used.    </p><br>
<h2><b>PROTOTYPE <br>
5.1.	Logo <br>
<img src="photos/amritji.jpg" alt="logo"><br>
<img src="photos/amrit.jpg" alt="icon"></b></h2>
<p>This is a logos which I had created. The top of logo is my logo of my website which locate at the middle of the navigation bar and the second one logo is my icon of each and every pages. The first image give scence that this is me. Its looks like me. And the second one I had created on the based on my name. Look Amrit the gentle man had created this website. I had used Photoshop and paint to make this logos and my photos as well. </p><br>

<h2><b>5.2.	 Visual Appeal</b></h2>
<p>All the websites must be eye friendly so I think I had made a website eye friendly. I had take some graphic visual ideas from online and I had shown it to my friends tutors and exports. According to the suggestion of these I had use a light color with in the line means I had not scattered the color here and there. And using some awesome fonts and light colorful color helps to make a website eye friendly. I had uses some animation gift and photos for the attraction of the user towards my websites. I hadn’t use unnecessary animation and picture, graphics, and videos. This website is simple but user friendly and knowledge full website.</p><br>
<h2><b>5.3.	Navigation</b></h2>
<p>Navigation is the most important for the user or customer who visit our websites. All the information is included inside the navigation bar. Like we have a navigation bar containing Home, About, CV, Social, Contact and report. Here home has all the information about any things but it is short in length. When we click on these links in navigation bar then it is directed on another page. Like when we are in index page then we click at the about at the navigation bar then it links us toward the about pages. <br>

    For the good understanding a system navigation diagram is most important to find or search any things inside the website for the users.  System navigation diagram is that which shows the entire path of navigation bar menus. It’s shows when we click on this where we reached this kind of information is given in a tree diagram. The System navigation diagram for my website is shown below

<h2><b>6.	Progression of website over 12 weeks. <br>
6.1.	Week 1-3
</b></h2>
<p>In first three week I take this very lightly and had only keep small research about this. I had created design in mind and what should I had to include and which color I had to use for which page and what kind of animation I had to use in every pages. I had got all ideas inside my mind. I think it is very easy to make I had a design and I had all the ideas and knowledge about html and Css. But in reality it is not so easy. My first three weeks gone without starting a project.</p><br>
<h2><b>6.2.	Week 3-6</b></h2>
<p>The idea I had created in first three weeks helps me in this week. First I had created all the sketches of all the web pages with photo animation and design. Then it is not enough for me to design the website then I started to create a wireframe for all the webpages. Till now I think that it is only for PCs. Then the responsive word comes into my mind then I started to make sketch and wireframe for the hand-held devices. Then at the end of the fifth over I had finished all the design part of my website. Only things to remaining is coding from that time. I was so excited at that time I am going to create a professional website. I had made a change in design as well. But the design of I had think and make is totally same.</p><br>
<h2><b>6.3.	Week 6-9</b></h2>
<p>In this week I had divided this time period into three. Like a first week, second week and third week. To divide my works. I had created these weeks for the easy to code for me.</p><br>
<h2><b>6.3.1.	First week</b></h2>
<p>In first week I had created a header, footer for all the webpages and make it responsive as I had designed in sketch and wireframe. Then I started to create a homepage for my website. I had collect all the information I had needed for homepage to make it too cute. After collecting information I started to coding. When I had finished a coding for the personal computer then I comes in form and make it responsive. There comes some error while making a page responsive. I had changes many design here to make it responsive. We have to care about margin and padding while making a page responsive. The work in this week is only making a header and footer and the home page for both PCs and smart phones.</p><br>
<h2><b>6.3.2.	Second Week</b></h2>
<p> In second week by using a header and footer as made in first week I had make a header and footer for my social page. Now from that I remember I hadn’t collect any information source for making these page the 2 days of second week goes without any coding and after that I had made a social page for PCs by inserting a image slider only by using a html and css. Then Given a Social media links to all of the social media. After that I had created a responsive page. And from these days I think to make a page responsive is too hard. Then from that day I got alert to make a page. I had focus on margin and padding of the page.</p><br>
<h2><b>6.3.3.	Third week</b></h2>
<p>In this week I had started my work by collecting the resource for my contact pages. After collecting all the useful resources, I start doing coding for the contact page. At this time I got full focused on margin of my page. This actually helps me to make a page responsive This page has to have a forms then I started to make a form and make the form valid. I finished this page in 5 days. And remaining 2 days I had collect the information for my next week.</p><br>
<h2><b>6.4.	Week 9-12</b></h2>
<p>This week’s make me sick. This week is the last weeks’ time duration to submit the works and I hadn’t completed the half of the assignment then it starts to give tension.
But I am a brave man so I can’t stop working I worked very much for this assignment. In this weeks’ duration also I had divide it into three parts. First week, Second week and Third week. 
</p><br>
<h2><b>6.4.1.	First week</b></h2>
<p>In first week I had created my Curriculum vitae page which I think the most easiest page to make. I know everything that I need What to write, what to display, how to design everything’s I made it fast and make it responsive  as soon as I can. Then collect the more information for my about page. Even I can’t design the design of about page earlier I had created and start coding from this phase.</p><br>
<h2><b>6.4.2.	Second week</b></h2>
<p>This all week spend by making about page for me. This week I feel uncomfortable to give time for this assignment. I had finished the about page with responsive in this week. And this much for this week.</p><br>
<h2><b>6.4.3.	Third week</b></h2>
<p>This is the last week of due of assignment. I feel so nervous about assignment. I had to do much works in this week. I had to create report. I had to validate all my html and css files. There is not the day in this week I had write an report. I wrote report little bit in a day. In this week I had check my or test my website. I had shared the design with my friends to check whether this design is good or not. I had run this website in hand-held device to check whether this page is responsive or not. Everything I had checked that I had remembered. And the sixth day of the week I had completed my all works. It is ready to submit. But also I hadn’t submitted because I also had to revise once more before submitting. At the final day I had revise all the coding and report and it is ready to submit.</p><br>

<h2><b>8.	Conclusion</b></h2>
<p>This project helps me to test my skills. This helps me to create a better portfolio which helps me to learn and understand the problems. I always got confused about the Margin and padding. It clearly gives me the concept of margin and padding. The making of pages responsive is one of the challenging tasks for me. I have not a clear concept of margin in website. Those one who got confused in margin and padding always got a problem while making a page responsive. Some of the error or warning are encounter when validate my html and css files then I don’t have enough time to ask with friends or tutor to solve this. So this is the only things I had regrets about. 
 This is a 12 weeks project it helps us the developer works within the time duration. And it helps the student to do wok in a given time and clear their doubts.
